# Molecular Property Prediction using Graph Neural Networks

This project is the result of my research on Molecular Property Prediction using Graph Neural Networks, and more specifically the prediction of solubility directly from the molecular structure.
This work comes from someone that had a background in Computer Vision and Machine Learning but no previous experience with cheminformatics or Graph Neural Networks.

To read more, see [the paper](Molecular_property_prediction_using_GNN.pdf).

To access the implementation, open [the notebook](Molecular_Property_Prediction_GNN.ipynb).
